{{#}} This is template for creating the output prompt.
{{#}}
{{#}} Tags
{{#}} --------------
{{#}}
{{#}} {{HEADER}} and {{FOOTER}} - A template should always have exactly one header and one footer tag.
{{#}} The text between {{HEADER}} and {{FOOTER}} tags is a template for individual file.
{{#}} The text above {{HEADER}} will be placed at top of the output prompt,
{{#}} and the text below {{FOOTER}} will be placed at the bottom.
{{#}}
{{#}} Item tags
{{#}} --------------
{{#}}
{{#}} These tags are used in individual file section:
{{#}} {{CONTENT}} - The content of the file.
{{#}} {{FILE_PATH}} - The path to the file that is being included in the prompt.
{{#}}
{{#}} Header/footer tags
{{#}} --------------
{{#}}
{{#}} These tags are used in the header and footer:
{{#}} {{ALL_FILE_PATHS}} - Paths to all files that are included in the output prompt.
{{#}} {{TREE}} - An ASCII tree representation the files paths.
{{#}}
{{#}} Global tags
{{#}} --------------
{{#}}
{{#}} Global tags can be used anywhere in the template:
{{#}} {{#}} - Comment tag for adding line comments to the template. The text after {{#}}
{{#}}         will not be included in the output for that line.
{{#}}
The following is my code:

{{HEADER}}
------ FILE START {{FILE_PATH}} ------

{{CONTENT}}

------ {{FILE_PATH}} FILE END ------

{{FOOTER}}
All files:
{{TREE}}

Reminding the important rules:
* Discuss the code changes first, don't suggest any code changes before we agreed on the approach.
* Think of an alternative/better way to do what I ask, don't simply follow my instructions.
* One small code change at a time.
* All code needs to be tested.
* Write code in such a way that so it can be used as a library, which also means it needs proper comments and documentation.
* Focus on code clarity and simplicity, even if it means writing more code (i.e. don't try to be smart or elegant D:).
* Write small functions that do one thing :D It makes the code simpler and easier to test.
* In the response text that is not the code, be very concise.

What do you think? Let's discuss ideas first without code :D
