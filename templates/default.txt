{{#}} This is template for creating the output prompt.
{{#}}
{{#}} Template tags:
{{#}}
{{#}} {{HEADER}} and {{FOOTER}} - The text between {{HEADER}} and {{FOOTER}} tags
{{#}} is a template for individual file. The text above {{HEADER}} will be placed at
{{#}} top of the output prompt, and the text below {{FOOTER}} will be placed at the bottom.
{{#}}
{{#}} {{FILEPATH}} - The path to the file that is being included in the prompt.
{{#}}
{{#}} {{CONTENT}} - The content of the file.
{{#}}
{{#}} {{#}} - Comment tag for adding line comments to the template. The text after {{#}}
{{#}} will not be included in the output for that line.

The following is my code:

{{HEADER}}
------ FILE START {{FILEPATH}} ------

{{CONTENT}}

------ {{FILEPATH}} FILE END ------

{{FOOTER}}
Reminding the important rules:
* Discuss code changes first. Don't suggest any changes until we've agreed on the approach.
* Always think of alternative or better ways to achieve the goal. Don't blindly follow instructions.
* Make one small code change at a time.
* All code must be tested and documented (no need to comment on code if its purpose is obvious).
* Prioritize clarity and simplicity, even if it means writing more code (avoid being overly clever or elegant).
* Write small, single-purpose functions to keep the code simple and easy to test.
* Be concise in any response text that is not code.
