# ToDo

Brainstorm ideas for future development:

* Add more installation options (pip, cargo, brew, apt, yum etc).
* Add platform-specific instructions on how to add binary to the PATH.
* More usage examples.
* Add file type based inclusions/exclusions (e.g. --include-type javascript --exclude-type binary image).
* Add option to show file tree.
* Set up continuous integration (CI) to run tests automatically on pushes and pull requests.
* Add issue and pull request templates.
